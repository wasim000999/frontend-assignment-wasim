# Frontend Intern Assignment - Wasim Akram
Demo project for the Cargo Matters Frontend Developer Intern selection task.

## What it includes
- `index.html` — one-page website
- `style.css` — styling and animations
- `script.js` — slider behavior and tooltip interactions
- `assets/` — placeholder SVG images and logo

## How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser to preview.
2. Replace `assets/*.svg` images with your own photos if desired.
3. Push the folder to a **public GitHub repository** and paste the repo URL in the submission email.

## Notes
- The project implements the required features: image scroller/slider, color-changing effect (CSS keyframes), and popup/tooltip on hover with fade-in transition.
- It's responsive — works on mobile and desktop.
